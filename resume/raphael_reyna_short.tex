\section{Open Source Projects}

{\bf LaTTe (Author)}\newline
LaTTe provides programmatic document generation as an HTTP service.
Users submit a templated LaTeX, following Go's templating format, and a JSON object and any resources they may need (such as images) to produce
a PDF document. Supports registering template and resource files to reduce traffic, CORS, caching, and has a flexbile persistence model.

  \columnbreak
\item {\bf Technologies Used: }\newline Docker, Bash, pdfTeX/pdfLaTeX
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

{\bf EinsteinPy (Contributor)}\newline
EinsteinPy is an open source pure Python package dedicated to problems arising in General Relativity and gravitational physics.
My contributions to the project were to increase performance by using my background in math to exploit symmetries in some of the underlying matrix and tensor computations.

{\bf Subseries Web App (Author)}\newline
A full-stack web app for computing massively parallel evaluations of complex
valued functions in real time using WebGL, written as a part of my Masters thesis on subseries of holomorphic functions.
Front end is written in Javascript and JSX using ReactJS.
Backend is written in python and is running as a Docker container on Heroku.
Can also be used to make really pretty fractal animations.

\section{RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE}
{\bf The Recovery Watchdog}\newline
{\it Lead Software Engineer}\newline
{\bf September 2019 - Present}\newline
At The Recovery Watchdog, I designed and developed the backend to the their patient management service.
The backend follows a microservice architecture, with all microservices written in Go and include tests.
I also managed, and was heavily involved with the development of the frontend mobile app which was written using React Native by 4 people including myself.
Additionally I wrote the Kubernetes manifests for both the development and testing deployments, which I also handled both on prem and on AWS respectively.

{\bf Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona, CA}\newline
{\it Mathematics Instructor}\newline
{\bf 2015 - Present}\newline
Responsibilities included designing a course schedule, complete with lecture and
evaluation material; as well as leading the class through the material and
regularly conducting evaluations of student performance.\newline
\ \newline
Courses taught include: Calculus I, Calculus II, Trigonometry, College Algebra,
Remedial Mathematics.
